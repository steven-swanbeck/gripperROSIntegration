PlatformIO Arduino code for to allow University of Nevada, Reno Smart Robotics Lab's TSA-Driven Soft Robotic Hand interface with ROS. 

The experimental branch shows efforts to parse long-form messages to control inidivual motors, their setpoints, and trigger macro commands. 

The pickplacePoC branch shows simplified, non-complex messaging in which messages consist of a single character sent via ROS to trigger exclusivley high-level commands for purpose of a basic pick-and-place demonstration using the hand mounted to a Universal Robots UR3e manipulator.
